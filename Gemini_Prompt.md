# Making AGI (a mixture of experts model)

## Summary

I am going to start a new project in the AI space. My project is jokingly called _AGI_. I have in mind that create a _mixture of experts_ type of model based on Qwen 3 4B. 

## What I have

- Access to good GPU's through modal or runpod. 
- Access to good people in the space.
- Base models.
- Ability to code and learn very fast (personal)

## What I aimed for 

- A model which is good at multiple tasks. Not really big, but good at multiple tasks.

## My questions

- How many topics should I cover in order to make my model?
- How can I advertise for this model when OpenAI, Google, Bytedance, etc. are dominating? 
- How can we distinguish amongst these huge AI companies?

## What you should do. 

Read the above document carefully, and ONLY answer _My Questions_ section precisely.
